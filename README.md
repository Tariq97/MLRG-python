# Machine learning based rupture generator

This repository contains code for Machine learning based rupture generator (MLRG)

## Features
- Generate a slip realization for given dimensions of fault following Mai and Beroza (2002)
- Hypocenter location can be specified manually or using Mai et al., (2005)
- Computes kinematic source parameters such as Onset times, rise times, peak slip velocities.
- Allows for source time functions (STFs) to be Yoffe or modified Yoffe using Machine learning.

## Usage
- Clone the repository using git clone
- Install all python libraries given in environment.yml
